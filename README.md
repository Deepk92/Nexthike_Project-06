Pharmaceutical Sales Prediction across multiple stores

Introduction :-  A company called Rossmann Pharmaceuticals has given a project on sales forecasting. The finance team wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal judgement to forecast sales. 

The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting sales across the various stores.

My job is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team. 

Objectives:-
The objective of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model that can forecast future pharmaceutical sales across multiple store locations. This will assist store managers in making informed decisions regarding stock levels and staffing, ultimately optimizing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.


Steps and Methods involved in the Project :-

Data Exploration :- Started by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure, data types, the range of values for each feature etc.

Data Preprocessing :- Handled missing values, outliers and inconsistencies in the dataset.

Task 1 - Exploration of customer purchasing behaviour

Task 2 - Prediction of store sales

Task 3 - Serving predictions on a web interface

PS :- Since the Model size is about 2.79 GB, hence it could not be uploaded here.


References :- Data sources, analytical tools, and methodologies such as Python Libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask, Joblib, Scikit-learn and Tensorflow etc for building and evaluating the predictive model in the VS code (Jupyter Notebook) environment, used in the project.
